This repository is a collectively evince of climate change using five factors, CO2, temperature, sea level, glacier volume, and ice sheet area.

All work for this assignment is in the `assignment` directory.  Code is contained in the `climate.Rmd` notebook and final rendered output files (`climate.md` and associated files) are in the `assignment` directory as well. Please check the `climate.md` for final product with graph and explanation.

The project started with a CO2 observation record in Hawaii, Mauna Loa in 1958. We want to show that climate change is not only happening but at a rapid rate and scale. Humans should take immediate, necessary actions to protect nature as well as ourselves from exacerbated climate change issues.
